# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: September 1, 2025

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts:** To start off the 100 days of code, I started down the path of building an android app using Ionic and AngularJS.
I downloaded Node.js and Android studio and the Java JDK. It was a bit confusion going through the NPM and Ionic commands. I mostly followed the tutorial to get the app up and running. 
The next issue I faced was getting the keystore generated. I solved this by double checking the path the keystore file was being saved to. It turns out I wasn't in the right directory for it to save it. Once I changed the path, the keystore generated with no further issues.
The app was the basic photo gallery. Not bad for the first Ionic App I’ve attempted to follow and do. I struggled with getting it uploaded into the Google play store. I didn’t realize that it had to be in AAB format and not the APK. 

I ran into a few additional issues uploading the AAB file to the Google Play store. 
1) the package nameing was an issue. It had to be in com.xxx.xxx format.
2) I didn't realize that the default package was already uploaded into the Play store so I had to rename my temp app.

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
